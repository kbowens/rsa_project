  <h1>A Visual Explanation for RSA Encryption</h1>
  <em>by Kevin Bradyn Owens</em>
  <p>
  	In any study of cryptography, it is not long before a student encounters the RSA algorithm. RSA is one of the algorithms that make of a unique class of cryptography called Asymmetric encryption. When I was learning RSA, I found that although there are many explanations of the algorithm that provide excellent detail about the steps required, I had a hard time gaining an intuitive understanding of the mathematical forces at work. I could read the steps of the algorithm, but I had trouble understanding key concepts, such as how the public and private key were different, and what part each numerical figure played in the secret transfer of data.

  	This visual essay attempts to combine textual explanations with interactive visualizations in the hopes that such a combination might prove useful to any student trying to gain an understanding not just of what computations are required to implement RSA encryption, but of the reasoning behind those calculations.
