  <h1>A Visual Explanation for RSA Encryption</h1>
  <em>by Kevin Bradyn Owens</em>
  <p>
  	In any study of cryptography, it is not long before a student encounters the RSA algorithm. RSA is one of the algorithms that make of a unique class of cryptography called Asymmetric encryption. When I was learning RSA, I found that although there are many explanations of the algorithm that provide excellent detail about the steps required, I had a hard time gaining an intuitive understanding of the mathematical forces at work. I could read the steps of the algorithm, but I had trouble understanding key concepts, such as how the public and private key were different, and what part each numerical figure played in the secret transfer of data.

  	This visual essay attempts to combine textual explanations with interactive visualizations in the hopes that such a combination might prove useful to any student trying to gain an understanding not just of what computations are required to implement RSA encryption, but of the reasoning behind those calculations.

  	The first part of the public key is a number we will call 'n'. Select two numbers, which we'll call p and q. These numbers must be prime. We will multiply them together, and that will give us n.
  	A note: usually, p,q and any other numbers discussed here would be much bigger. For the purposes of a simpler explanation, smaller numbers are probably better.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The second part of the public key is a number, 'e', which has to be relatively prime to phi(pq) [This is gonna need some king of explanation.] It is usually quite large, but in some cases can be as low as 3.

  	Now we are done with the public key. With this knowledge, the any sender can send a message that only the intended person can read. Here's how:

  <p>
  	The sender must convert a message into a number. Try a simple message here, [convert to unicode or something]
